				<h2>How can you <strong>stop</strong> spammers?</h2>
				<p>Your website continually being attacked by bots & spammers, web-Crawlers, and attempts to publicise spammy websites from your contact forms and logs - using the computing resources you want to keep for your actual customers, and adding noise to your logs and stats.

                At BotRegistry, we spend our days checking all the publiy (and other) lists of problem-webcrawlers & drive-by spammers, running many more active, and passive checks - so you can concentrate on business.</p>
